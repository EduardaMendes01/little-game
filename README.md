# Mini Pixel Art Game
 A mini pixel art game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Still in development, many improvements and features to be implemented).

## About the Game
This mini pixel art game is a personal project showcasing my skills in game development using core web technologies. The game features custom-made pixel art and provides an engaging experience for players.

## Note
